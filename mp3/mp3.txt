Breaking the Most Complex User Story into at Least 3 Tasks
==========================================================

<Encryption/Decryption (12)>
Task A: Encryption
Once the user has pressed the send button,and before the message is sent over the HTTP protocol, we will encrypt the message using UTF-8. 
Task B: Transfer
After the message is encrypted, we will send the user’s message using the Client/Server protocol via HTTP. 
Task C: Decryption
Once the encrypted message has been successfully received by the recipient, we will decrypt the message before displaying it to the recipient.
